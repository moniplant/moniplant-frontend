### Roadmap:

1. **Define Requirements:**
   - List the information you want to store for each plant.
   - Identify the sensors you'll use for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
   - Decide on the microservices you want to build.

2. **Setup Raspberry Pi:**
   - Install the necessary operating system on the Raspberry Pi (e.g., Raspbian).
   - Set up network connectivity.

3. **Database Setup:**
   - Choose a database system suitable for a Raspberry Pi (e.g., SQLite or lightweight NoSQL databases).
   - Design a schema for storing plant information and sensor data.

4. **Backend Microservices:**
   - **Plant Service:**
      - Manages information about each plant.
      - Exposes APIs for CRUD operations on plant data.

   - **Sensor Service:**
      - Manages information about sensors.
      - Associates sensors with specific plants.
      - Records sensor data.

   - **Data Service:**
      - Manages data storage and retrieval.
      - Handles the interactions with the database.
      - May include APIs for fetching aggregated data.

   - **Notification Service:**
      - Optional: Sends notifications based on predefined thresholds (e.g., low soil moisture).

5. **Sensor Integration:**
   - Interface with the sensors using appropriate libraries or APIs.
   - Implement code to read sensor data and store it in the database.

6. **API Gateway:**
   - Create an API Gateway to manage communication between frontend and microservices.
   - Implement security measures to authenticate and authorize requests.

7. **Frontend:**
   - Design the user interface for plant monitoring.
   - Develop frontend components to fetch data from the API Gateway.
   - Visualize plant information, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.

8. **Containerization (Optional):**
   - Consider using Docker for containerization to simplify deployment.

9. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy microservices on the Raspberry Pi.
   - Ensure proper networking and security configurations.

10. **Testing:**
   - Perform unit tests for each microservice.
   - Conduct integration tests to ensure components work together.

11. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    - Implement logging for each microservice.
    - Set up monitoring to detect and respond to issues.

12. **Scale (Optional):**
    - If needed, consider scaling components horizontally or optimizing performance.

### Architecture Analysis:

- **Microservices:**
  - Microservices provide modularity and scalability.
  - Each microservice focuses on a specific aspect (plants, sensors, data storage, notifications).

- **Database:**
  - Use a lightweight database suitable for the Raspberry Pi.
  - Consider NoSQL databases for flexibility in storing sensor data.

- **Sensor Integration:**
  - Implement code in the Sensor Service to read sensor data and associate it with plants.
  - Use appropriate libraries or APIs for sensor communication.

- **API Gateway:**
  - Centralizes communication between frontend and microservices.
  - Handles security, authentication, and request routing.

- **Frontend:**
  - Fetches data from the API Gateway.
  - Visualizes plant information and sensor data.

- **Containerization (Optional):**
  - Containerizing microservices simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across environments.

- **Testing:**
  - Unit tests ensure individual microservices work correctly.
  - Integration tests validate interactions between microservices.

- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Implement logging to track errors and events in each microservice.
  - Set up monitoring to detect performance issues.

- **Scale (Optional):**
  - Consider scaling individual microservices based on usage patterns.
